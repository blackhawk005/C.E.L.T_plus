My vacation was fantastic! I had an amazing time with my family. Each day, I indulged 
in my favorite food, and every evening, we played our favorite board games. It was a 
nostalgic experience that reminded me of our childhood. I also got to reconnect with 
some of my childhood friends. However, I wish it was longer. I felt sad while on my flight 
back home, but I am already looking forward to planning my next vacation.
